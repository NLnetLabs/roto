# Roto Sublime Text Syntax

This folder contains the `sublime-syntax` grammar for Roto. This is used by,
among others:

- Sublime Text
- VS Code
- Typst
- Discourse

We use Typst to test this syntax highlighting easily without having to open Sublime Text, at least visually.

```bash
# for a single run
typst compile test.typ

# to watch the file
typst watch test.typ
```
