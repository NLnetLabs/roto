Goals
=====

By now, you might like the idea of Roto, but you're not sure whether it is the
right fit for your project. To help you figure that out, we explain some of the
design goals and their consequences below.

Easy to learn and use
---------------------

Experienced programmers should be able to pick it up easily. Since it is a
new language, we are careful to not make it too surprising for most users.
We try to use familiar symbols and keywords for common operations that most
users will recognize. We want the compiler to emit clear error messages that
help users diagnose their problems. We do not want to add concepts that many
programmers might not be familiar with, especially when coming from scripting
languages. An example of this is that Roto is garbage collected and has no
ownership concepts like Rust.

Designed to be integrated
-------------------------

Any Rust application should be able to add support for Roto scripts with
minimal hassle. Roto can be added to a project simply by adding the crate
as a dependency to a project. We do not want to require the presence of any
other libraries or executables. We want it to be easy to expose Rust types
and functions to Roto scripts. Roto doesnâ€™t produce its own binaries, but is
always embedded into some host application. Since the host application decides
what to expose to the scripts, we do not have an extensive standard library.

Reliable
--------

We want you to be able to rely on a Roto script once it is compiled. It should
be possible to use Roto in critical software that needs to be run reliably. To
achieve this, Roto is statically typed and memory-safe. We also do not want it
to crash the process.

Good Performance
----------------

We want Roto to be faster than most other embedded scripting languages.
However, we do not need to compete with other statically typed and compiled
languages. Roto will be most suited for applications that compile a script once
and then run that many times.

Non-goals
---------

We also have some things we're not trying to achieve with Roto.

- We do not aim to be as fast as the fastest languages around, like Rust and
  C.
- We do not make compilation speed a priority.
- Roto is not sandboxed, so running untrusted scripts is probably not a good
  idea. WebAssembly might be a better fit if this is important to you. Roto is
  more suited for applications where the author of the scripts is also the
  person running the application.
- Roto is not designed to be picked up as a first programming language.

Conclusion
----------

Roto is probably a good fit for your application if it requires flexible
configuration or plugins, that need to be executed many times quickly and
reliably. The more times a script is executed per compilation, the more useful
Roto will be to you.

It is probably not a good fit if you need to execute untrusted scripts, if you
need the capabilities of dynamic scripting languages or only use one-off
scripts.

Hopefully, that gives you enough information to decide whether Roto is right
for you. If it is, you can read on!
