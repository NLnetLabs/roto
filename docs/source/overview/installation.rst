Installation
============

Roto is meant to be included into a host application as a crate, to learn how
to do that, see :doc:`embedding`. In this case, you don't need a separate
compiler to use Roto. However, there is also a binary of the Roto
compiler that you can use to play around with the language.

Installing the compiler
-----------------------

The standalone compiler can be installed using cargo:

.. code-block:: bash

  cargo install --locked roto

Editor support
